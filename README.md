# IoT Device Integration with ESP32

## Introduction

This project demonstrates the integration of IoT devices using the ESP32 microcontroller and the Arduino IDE. By establishing a connection between the ESP32 and a server, this project showcases how IoT devices can communicate over Wi-Fi networks, making it an ideal starting point for various IoT applications.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) installed on your computer.
- An ESP32 board. If you haven't already, you can [set up your ESP32 board in Arduino IDE](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/installing-the-esp32-board-in-arduino-ide-windows-instructions/) using the board manager.
- Basic understanding of C++ programming and IoT concepts.
